# Product Context

**Why this project exists:** This project addresses the need to expand the capabilities of existing MCP servers and improve the developer experience when working with these servers. By adding new tools and commands, we aim to make the servers more versatile and user-friendly. The `filesystem-extended` server specifically aims to provide more comprehensive file system operations.

**Problems it solves:**

*   **Limited functionality:** Existing MCP servers may lack specific tools or commands that are needed for certain tasks.
*   **Inconsistent configuration:** Setting up and configuring MCP servers can be complex and inconsistent across different environments.
*   **Lack of documentation:** Understanding the capabilities and usage of MCP servers can be challenging without proper documentation.

**How it should work:** The project involves modifying existing MCP server code (where possible) and creating new MCP servers to add the desired functionality. The new tools should be well-documented and easy to use. The configuration process should be streamlined and consistent across different environments.

**User experience goals:**

*   **Intuitive:** Developers should be able to easily understand and use the new tools and commands.
*   **Efficient:** The new tools should improve developer workflow and reduce the time required to complete tasks.
*   **Consistent:** The configuration and usage of MCP servers should be consistent across different environments.
*   **Well-documented:** Developers should be able to easily find information about the available tools and commands.
