# Progress

**What Works:**

*   `filesystem-extended` server is created and configured.
*   `copy_file`, `delete_file`, `get_directory_size`, and `create_symlink` tools are implemented and tested in `filesystem-extended`.
*   MCP server configurations are synchronized across VS Code extensions and Claude Desktop app.
*   Claude app path added to allowed directories.
*   Memory bank directory and initial files created.

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Implement new tools for other MCP servers based on the plan.
*   Update documentation for modified MCP servers.

**Current Status:**

*   Initial setup and configuration of `filesystem-extended` is complete.
*   Basic memory bank structure is in place.
*   `filesystem-extended` server is configured in all required locations.
*  Ready to start creating the plan for adding tools to other MCP servers.

**Known Issues:**
