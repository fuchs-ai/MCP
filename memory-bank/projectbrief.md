# Project Brief

**Project Title:** MCP Server Enhancement and Tool Addition

**Objective:** The primary goal of this project is to enhance existing MCP servers by adding new tools and commands based on their README documentation. This involves analyzing the capabilities of each server, identifying potential improvements, and implementing those improvements through code modifications and additions. The project also includes setting up a new MCP server (`filesystem-extended`) and configuring it across multiple VS Code extensions and the Claude desktop app.

**Scope:**

*   Analyze README files of existing MCP servers.
*   Identify potential new tools and commands for each server.
*   Implement new tools for the `filesystem-extended` server.
*   Configure the `filesystem-extended` server in multiple VS Code extensions and the Claude desktop app.
*   Create a memory bank to document the project and its progress.
*   Develop a plan for adding new tools to all identified MCP servers.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Major refactoring of existing MCP servers.
*   Adding tools that are not related to the core functionality of the existing servers.
*   Creating entirely new MCP servers (except for `filesystem-extended`).

**Success Criteria:**

*   Successful implementation of new tools for `filesystem-extended`.
*   Correct configuration of `filesystem-extended` across all target environments.
*   A comprehensive memory bank documenting the project.
*   A detailed plan for adding new tools to other MCP servers.
